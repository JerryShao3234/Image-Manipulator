## Image-Manipulator

##Overview

This is a program that allows users to manipulate .bmp image files in the following ways:
- applying a colour filter
- coverting to black and white
- inverting the colours

The program is command line based, and is relatively straightforward to use. Make sure image files are in the correct project directory.

##Demo

There are included images of the before-and-after effects of the manipulation.
